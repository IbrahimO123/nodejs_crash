      Firebase evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin
      and Andrew Lee in 2011. Envolve provided developers an API that enables
      the integration of online chat functionality into their websites. After
      releasing the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used
      to pass application data that were not chat messages. Developers were
      using Envolve to sync application data such as game state in real time
      across their users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system
      and the real-time architecture that powered it.They founded Firebase
      as a separate company in 2011 and it launched to the public in April 2012
